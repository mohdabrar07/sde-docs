# üåê Computer Network Tutorial

**Last Updated:** 18 Sep, 2025  

A **Computer Network** is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share **data, resources, and information**.  
These networks can range from simple setups (like connecting two devices at home) to massive global systems like the **Internet**.

## üìò Uses of Computer Networks

- **Sharing Devices:**  
  Multiple systems can use shared hardware such as printers and scanners, reducing duplication and costs.

- **Sharing Data:**  
  Teams can work on shared documents, applications, or systems to boost efficiency.

- **Communication:**  
  Enables real-time and delayed communication via web, email, video calls, and instant messaging.

- **Data Management:**  
  Centralized or distributed data storage helps in easy management, security, and backup.

- **Remote Access:**  
  Users can log into systems, servers, or cloud platforms from different locations, supporting remote work and 24/7 access.

## üß© Fundamentals of Computer Network

This section introduces the **core concepts** behind computer networking, including its **benefits, characteristics,** and **essential hardware components**.

# üñ•Ô∏è Basics of Computer Networking

**Last Updated:** 18 Sep, 2025  

A **Computer Network** is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, printers, etc.) that share **resources and information**.  
Networks allow efficient data exchange, enabling applications such as **email**, **file sharing**, and **internet browsing**.

## üß† Basic Terminologies of Computer Networks

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Network** | A group of connected computers/devices that can communicate and share data. |
| **Node** | Any device that can send, receive, or forward data (e.g., laptop, mobile, server). |
| **Networking Devices** | Devices that manage or support networking functions (e.g., router, switch, hub). |
| **Transmission Media** | The medium through which data travels (wired or wireless). |
| **Wired Media** | Ethernet cables, optical fiber. |
| **Wireless Media** | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared. |
| **Service Provider Networks** | Networks provided by ISPs or carriers to give access to users or organizations. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does a Computer Network Work?

- **Network Node:** Any device (router, modem, computer) that sends or receives data.  
- **Link:** The physical or wireless medium connecting nodes.  
- **Working:**  
  Networks use **protocols** (rules) to send and receive data.  
  Each device has a **unique IP Address** for identification.

- **Firewall:**  
  A security tool (hardware/software) that monitors traffic and allows or blocks data based on rules.

## üèóÔ∏è Types of Computer Network Architecture

### 1. Client-Server Architecture

Nodes are either **servers** or **clients**.  
Servers manage resources and handle requests from client nodes.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

No central server exists.  
Each device can act as both **client and server**, sharing data directly with others.

## üß∞ Network Devices

A network includes various devices that enable data transfer and connectivity.  
These devices are also known as **networking components**.

### 1. Router

- Connects multiple networks (e.g., home network ‚Üî internet).  
- Directs data packets to their correct destination.

### 2. Switch

- Connects multiple devices within a LAN (e.g., office computers).  
- Forwards data only to the target device, improving efficiency.

### 3. Hub

- Basic device that connects multiple devices.  
- Broadcasts data to all devices (less efficient than a switch).

### 4. Bridge

- Connects and filters traffic between two networks or segments.  
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic.

### 5. Gateway

- Connects different types of networks.  
- Translates data between different protocols.

### 6. Access Point (AP)

- Provides **wireless connectivity**.  
- Extends a wired network into a Wi-Fi network.

### 7. Modem

- Converts **digital data ‚Üî analog signals** for phone/cable lines.  
- Provides internet access.

### 8. Firewall

- Monitors and controls **incoming/outgoing traffic**.  
- Protects against unauthorized access and threats.

## üéØ Goals of Networks

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Convenience** | Simplifies computer use for users. |
| **Efficiency** | Manages hardware resources for better performance. |
| **Resource Management** | Fair and efficient allocation of CPU, memory, I/O, and storage. |
| **Security & Protection** | Prevents unauthorized data and resource access. |
| **Reliability & Fault Tolerance** | Ensures smooth operation and quick recovery from failures. |
| **Scalability** | Supports growth in users and resources without performance drop. |

## üí° Uses of Computer Networks

- **Communication:** Email, chat, and video conferencing.  
- **Resource Sharing:** Share printers, scanners, and files to save cost and effort.  
- **Remote Access:** Access data/systems from anywhere.  
- **Collaboration:** Work together on projects, share ideas, review work.  
- **E-Commerce:** Enables online shopping and secure transactions.  
- **Education:** Supports online learning and research.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Characteristics of Computer Networks

### 1. üîí Security

- Protects data from unauthorized access, hacking, and viruses.  
- Uses **firewalls**, **encryption**, and **authentication**.

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Reliability

- Ensures data and resources are always available.  
- **Redundancy** and **backups** maintain uptime.

### 3. üìà Scalability

- Handles more devices/users without losing performance.  
- Example: The **Internet** supports millions of new users daily.

### 4. ‚ö° High Performance

- Ensures fast data transfer, low latency, and high throughput.  
- Depends on **bandwidth**, **response time**, and **processing power**.

### 5. üõ∞Ô∏è Quality of Service (QoS)

- Prioritizes important data for faster delivery.  
- Ensures smooth streaming and real-time communication.

## üßæ Summary

A **computer network** connects devices to share data, resources, and services efficiently.  
It enables **communication, collaboration, and remote access** while maintaining **security, reliability, and scalability**.
