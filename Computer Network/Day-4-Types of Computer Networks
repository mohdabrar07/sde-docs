# Types of Computer Networks

**Last Updated:** 20 Sep, 2025

A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. It is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either cable or wireless media. Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.

## Classification of Computer Networks

Computer networks are classified based on several factors, such as geographical area, ownership, architecture, topology, and transmission technology.

---

## Classification Based on Geographical Area

This is the most common way of classifying networks.

### 1. Personal Area Network (PAN)

PAN is the most basic type of computer network. It is a type of network designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person. It allows your personal devices, like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearables, to communicate and share data with each other.

**Characteristics:**
- Network range: 1 to 10 meters
- Transmission speed: Very high
- Maintenance: Very easy
- Cost: Very low

**Examples:**
- Bluetooth connection between a phone and wireless earbuds
- Infrared communication between TV and remote

---

### 2. Local Area Network (LAN)

LAN is the most frequently used network. It is a computer network that connects computers through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, that is, locally. A LAN encompasses two or more computers connected over a server. The two important technologies involved in this network are Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

**Characteristics:**
- Range: Up to 2 km
- Transmission speed: Very high
- Maintenance: Easy
- Cost: Low

**Examples:**
- Wi-Fi in a home or school
- Wired LAN in a company's office

---

### 3. Campus Area Network (CAN)

CAN is bigger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN. This is a type of computer network that is usually used in places like a school or colleges. This network covers a limited geographical area that is, it spreads across several buildings within the campus.

**Characteristics:**
- Technology: Mainly Ethernet
- Range: Few kilometers
- Transmission speed: Very high
- Maintenance cost: Moderate
- Cost: Moderate

**Examples:**
- Networks that cover schools, colleges, buildings, etc.

---

### 4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A MAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. This is the type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town, or metropolitan area.

**Characteristics:**
- Technology: FDDI, CDDI, and ATM
- Range: 5 km to 50 km
- Transmission speed: Average
- Maintenance: Difficult
- Cost: High

**Examples:**
- Networking in towns, cities, a single large city
- A large area within multiple buildings

---

### 5. Wide Area Network (WAN)

WAN is a type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path. It is not restrained to a single location but extends over many locations. WAN can also be defined as a group of local area networks that communicate with each other.

**Characteristics:**
- Technology: Leased-Line & Dial-up
- Range: Above 50 km
- Transmission speed: Very low
- Maintenance: Very high
- Cost: Very high

**Examples:**
- The Internet (largest WAN)
- Banking networks linking global branches

## Classification Based on Transmission Technology

### 1. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

WLAN is a type of computer network that acts as a local area network but makes use of wireless network technology like Wi-Fi. This network doesn't allow devices to communicate over physical cables like in LAN but allows devices to communicate wirelessly.

**Most common example:** Wi-Fi

---

### 2. System Area Network (SAN)

A System Area Network is designed to connect high-performance computers within a localized, high-speed environment, such as in data centers or supercomputing facilities. A SAN provides access to block-level data storage.

**Examples:**
- A network of disks accessed by a network of servers

---

### 3. Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)

A POLAN is a type of computer network that is an alternative to a LAN. POLAN uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from a single strand of single-mode optical fiber to multiple signals to distribute users and devices. In short, POLAN is a point to multipoint LAN architecture.

## Classification Based on Ownership and Access Control

We can classify networks into three main types based on ownership and how access is controlled: Private, Public, and Hybrid networks.

### 1. Private Network

These are networks completely owned and managed by a single organization or individual. The owner controls who can connect, what they can do, and how data moves within the network. Since there is no outside access, they are highly secure and reliable, often protected by firewalls and strict policies.

**Examples:**
- A company's internal office network (Intranet)
- School or college campus networks
- Hospital systems storing patient data

---

### 2. Public Network

These are networks open to the general public and are usually provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or businesses in public places. They offer basic or no authentication, making them less secure and vulnerable to attacks if not used carefully.

**Examples:**
- Public Wi-Fi at cafes or airports
- Free hotspots in city centers
- Internet (the largest public network)

---

### 3. Hybrid Network

A hybrid network blends private and public access, offering flexibility and role-based access control. Some parts are restricted (like internal systems), while others are open (like guest Wi-Fi). This setup is useful in environments where different users need different access levels.

**Example:**
- A university network with private access for staff and students and limited access for guests

---

## Internetwork

An internetwork is a setup where two or more networks (like LANs or WANs) are interconnected using routers or gateways, allowing communication between them. This process is called internetworking.

### 1. Intranet

An intranet is a private network used within an organization. It allows employees to access internal tools, documents, and systems securely. It's not available to the public, and typically uses private IP addresses.

**Examples:**
- Company HR portals
- Internal knowledge bases
- Staff-only communication tools

---

### 2. Extranet

An extranet is an extension of the intranet that provides limited, secure access to outsiders such as partners, vendors, or clients. It's used to collaborate across organizations while maintaining internal security.

**Examples:**
- Supplier portals
- Client dashboards for project updates
- Partner login systems for shared services

## Summary Table

| Network Type | Range | Speed | Cost | Maintenance |
|--------------|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| PAN | 1-10 m | Very High | Very Low | Very Easy |
| LAN | Up to 2 km | Very High | Low | Easy |
| CAN | Few km | Very High | Moderate | Moderate |
| MAN | 5-50 km | Average | High | Difficult |
| WAN | Above 50 km | Very Low | Very High | Very High |
