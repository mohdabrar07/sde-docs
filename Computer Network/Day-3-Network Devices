# Network Devices Documentation

**Last Updated:** 03 Oct, 2025

Network devices are fundamental hardware components in computer networking that operate across different layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models. They facilitate data transmission, regulate traffic flow, provide interconnectivity between heterogeneous networks, and enforce security policies.

> **Note:** Depending on their functionality, these devices perform tasks such as signal regeneration, frame forwarding, packet switching, routing, protocol conversion, and access control to ensure reliable, efficient, and secure communication.

## Functions of Network Devices

- Enable communication by transmitting and receiving data between devices
- Allow devices to connect to networks efficiently and securely
- Improve network performance by reducing congestion and managing traffic
- Provide security by controlling access and preventing unauthorized activities
- Extend network coverage and solve signal loss or attenuation problems

## Common Networking Devices

### 1. Access Point (AP)

- Creates a wireless local area network (WLAN)
- Allows wireless devices (smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) to connect to a wired network
- Commonly used in offices, homes, and public areas to extend Wi-Fi coverage

### 2. Modem

- Stands for **Modulator/Demodulator**
- Converts digital signals from computers into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines, cable systems, or wireless media, and vice versa
- Acts as the primary internet access device for users

**Types of Modems:**
- **DSL Modem:** Uses telephone lines, slower than cable
- **Cable Modem:** Uses TV cables, faster than DSL
- **Wireless Modem:** Provides internet via Wi-Fi
- **Cellular Modem:** Uses mobile data networks

### 3. Firewall

- A security device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic
- Blocks unauthorized access while allowing trusted data
- Can be hardware-based, software-based, or cloud-based
- Protects against hackers, malware, and cyber threats

### 4. Repeater

- Operates at the **Physical Layer** of the OSI model
- Regenerates and amplifies weak signals to extend network range
- Commonly used in large LANs or WANs to solve signal attenuation issues

### 5. Hub

- A multiport repeater used in star topology networks
- Broadcasts data to all connected devices, regardless of the destination
- Inefficient compared to switches due to collisions

**Types of Hubs:**
- **Active Hub:** Boosts signals, acts as a repeater
- **Passive Hub:** Relays signals without amplification
- **Intelligent Hub:** Provides monitoring and management functions

### 6. Bridge

- Operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
- Connects and filters traffic between two LAN segments
- Uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended segment

**Types of Bridges:**
- **Transparent Bridge:** Learns MAC addresses automatically
- **Source Routing Bridge:** Follows routes specified by the sender

### 7. Switch

- An advanced form of a bridge with multiple ports
- Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and selectively forwards packets
- Reduces collisions by creating separate collision domains

**Types of Switches:**
- **Unmanaged Switches:** Plug-and-play, simple use
- **Managed Switches:** Supports VLANs, QoS, link aggregation
- **Layer 2 Switches:** Forward frames within the same network
- **Layer 3 Switches:** Perform routing between different networks
- **PoE Switches:** Provide power and data through the same cable
- **Gigabit Switches:** Support high-speed Ethernet
- **Modular Switches:** Expandable and customizable for large networks

### 8. Router

- Operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
- Uses IP addresses to route data between different networks (LAN to WAN)
- Maintains a routing table to decide the best path
- Divides broadcast domains for better efficiency

### 9. Gateway

- Acts as a protocol converter
- Connects two networks using different architectures or protocols
- Can work at any OSI layer depending on its function
- Examples: connecting an enterprise LAN to the internet

### 10. Brouter (Bridging Router)

- A hybrid device with features of both a Bridge and a Router
- Works at Data Link Layer (as bridge) and Network Layer (as router)
- Routes packets between networks and filters traffic within LANs

### 11. NIC (Network Interface Card)

- A hardware adapter that enables a computer to connect to a network
- Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
- Has a unique MAC address for identification
- Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi)

## Summary

Network devices form the backbone of modern communication infrastructure, each serving specific purposes across different network layers. Understanding these devices is essential for designing, implementing, and troubleshooting network systems effectively.
